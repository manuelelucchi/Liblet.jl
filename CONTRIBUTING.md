# Contributing

Any suggestions and/or contributions are welcome.

I plan to greatly expand the library to support famous tools such as Antlr (if possible), but also more interactivity (for Jupyter Notebooks) and even some integrations with the Symbol type of Julia lang. I hope to reach soon feature parity with the python version. So any contributions meant to achieve these features would be top priority.

Still, I'm using this project to improve my Julia skills, so any suggestion on the code quality would be really useful.

Thank you for contributing!
